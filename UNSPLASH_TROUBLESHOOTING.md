# Unsplash API Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Current Issue: "Image failed to load" with short data length

The error you're seeing (Data length: 1211) indicates that the Unsplash API is returning an error response instead of an image.

## üîç Quick Diagnosis

Run this test to see what's happening:

```bash
cd server
node debug-unsplash.js
```

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ If your API key is present
- ‚úÖ If the API call is successful
- ‚úÖ What the actual response contains

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. No API Key
**Problem**: `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` not set in `.env`
**Solution**: 
1. Go to https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Copy your Access Key (not Secret Key!)
5. Add to `server/.env`: `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here`

### 2. Wrong API Key Format
**Problem**: Using Secret Key instead of Access Key
**Solution**: 
- Use the **Access Key** (starts with something like `abc123...`)
- NOT the Secret Key (starts with something like `def456...`)

### 3. Rate Limit Exceeded
**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded" error
**Solution**: 
- Free tier: 5,000 requests/month
- Wait until next month or upgrade

### 4. Invalid API Key
**Problem**: "Unauthorized" error
**Solution**: 
- Check your API key is correct
- Make sure you copied the entire key
- Verify the key is active in your Unsplash developer dashboard

### 5. Network Issues
**Problem**: Timeout or connection errors
**Solution**: 
- Check your internet connection
- Try again later
- The app will automatically fall back to placeholder images

## üéØ What to Do Right Now

1. **Check your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_access_key_here
   ```

2. **Run the debug script**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node debug-unsplash.js
   ```

3. **Check the console output** for:
   - API key presence
   - Response status
   - Error messages

4. **If API key is missing/wrong**:
   - Get a new one from Unsplash
   - Update your `.env` file
   - Restart the server

5. **If everything looks good but still fails**:
   - The app will automatically use placeholder images
   - You can still use the app without Unsplash

## üîÑ Fallback System

The app has multiple fallbacks:
1. **Unsplash API** (if key provided)
2. **Pixabay API** (if key provided)  
3. **Placeholder service** (no key needed)
4. **Custom SVG** (always works)

So even if Unsplash fails, you'll still get images!

## üìû Need Help?

1. Check the server console for detailed error messages
2. Run the debug script to see what's happening
3. Verify your API key format and permissions
4. The app works without any API keys - it will use local placeholders
